description: |
  A Helm chart for deploying FireFly and its various plugin microservices onto Kubernetes.
  By default allows the user to deploy FireFly with a single multi-party namespace, with the
  ability to template additional multi-party or gateway namespaces.
type: application

appVersion: "1.3.3"

# Generally we follow this practice for updates to the chart version number:
#  - Significant changes to the structure or purpose of the chart (major version update)
#  - FireFly major release (minor version update)
#  - Smaller release and updates (patch version updates)
#
# For example, a release of FireFly like 1.3.1 -> 1.3.2 would correlate to a patch version
# update, whereas a change like 1.2.2 -> 1.3.0 would be a minor version update.
